## Clean code architecture

- Bellow are few concepts I've focused & followed while building this architecture
    - SOLID Principles
    - The Onion Architecture
    - Factory Pattern & Static Factories
    - Adapter Pattern
    - Repository Pattern
- The main benefit of having this kind of architecture is to keep your core business logic testable
